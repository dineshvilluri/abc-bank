Significantly improved unit test coverage to more than 20% overall from less than 1% for cdds projects  
Completed development on Kafka, Jdbc and File event loggers with significant unit test coverage.  
Involved in all phases of development - Requirement analysis, gained HBase knowledge, development, QA support, production support etc. in doing file validation, ingestion, search API and purge functionalities for both Assurant and Corelogic vendors. Also, made the build ready to ingest data into UAT and DR environments from prod. Generated bulk files from the sample data supplied by vendor and tested the program.  
Gained knowledge of CDS environment and projects, use of mockito and power mockito to write more matured unit test cases, thorough testing to reduce iterations between devlopment and qa etc. Also, worked on other projects like Bulk Registration, ODBC/JDBC stress testing  
Worked with business and QA teams during testing, release process from development -> QA -> UAT -> Prod and support other operational procedures to ensure new technology is properly understood and tested to see no issues during ingestion process.  
Involved in all phases of development - Requirement analysis, development, QA support, production support etc. in doing file validation, ingestion, search API and purge functionalities for Intersection vendor with structured data to HBase and unstructured to HDFS. Successfully disengaged Intersections Vendor.
Development  on generic framework for HBase Ingestion for structured data through portal registration.
Release to encrypt Assurant and Corelogic Image files. Required support to successfully disengage Corelogic Vendor and debug the issues with Assurant vendor files. Data Transporter Knoweledge transfer and do support work. HBase support to the team whenever required like Neokami etc.
